![[Come Play.mp3]]

You’re not alone

Look at my shadow, I’m behind you like a ghost

Mission “Die a legend” is a go

The way I flow, taking all the shots

Landing free throws, beast mode

Double snake eyes, Turn ‘em all to stone

And you’re a student of war

내가 되갚을 때면

I’ll leave you begging for more

뼛속 깊이 느껴 넌

그 문을 여는 순간

더이상 Game은 없어

별다른 해답은 None

처음 맛보는 광경

Try me I dare you to try me

Took me long but I’m here

Coming down like lightning

Taking back what’s mine

It was a matter of time

If you wanna come play

You gotta start with me

And the monsters in my head

In my head

Got blood on my hands

And you’re my revenge

You pushed me to the edge

The edge

Do you wanna come play?

Te la viviste

Si en mi no creías

Llegamo' con el combo ready

Pa' hacerles una avería

ía

Cuidao que tengo mecha corta

Y puede que te explote la encía

Prendo fuego y te quemo toa la mercancía

Mejor pedir perdon que pedir permiso

Me la improviso

Y a toa esta gente le doy contra el piso

Si quieren medir fuerza

Les tengo un aviso:

Mas mala suerte con la nena

Q dispara y preciso

Try me I dare you to try me

Took me long but I'm here

Coming down like lightning

Taking back whats mine

It was a matter of time

If you wanna come play

You gotta start with me

And the monsters in my head

In my head

Got blood on my hands

And you’re my revenge

You pushed me to the edge

The edge

Do you wanna come play?

Do you wanna come play?

If you wanna come play

You gotta start with me

And the monsters in my head

In my head

Got blood on my hands

And you’re my revenge

You pushed me to the edge

The edge

Do you wanna come play?
