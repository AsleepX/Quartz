[Verse 1]

Azure airplane in the sky

Disco music floating by

Landing in the endless park

Where we wander after dark

[Chorus]

You fly into fields of flowers

Where taro grows larger than my head

Drinking dewdrops by the lake

I'm missing you, I'm missing you

[Verse 2]

I turn the lens to find your face

Pull you closer through the space

No flowers bloom where I remain

So we sail on souls untamed

[Bridge]

Fishing for tulips, vibrant and bright

Crossing dimensions in the fading light

Dreams connect us when we're apart

The surreal journey of heart to heart

[Chorus]

You fly into fields of flowers

Where taro grows larger than my head

Drinking dewdrops by the lake

I'm missing you, I'm missing you

[Outro]

In azure dreams we meet again

Where disco planes and flowers blend
